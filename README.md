# Jet-Engine-Design
Project Overview

This project represents a conceptual jet engine assembly modeled in PTC Creo Parametric for learning and skill development purposes. The objective was to understand jet engine architecture, component interaction, assembly constraints, and parametric modeling techniques used in aerospace mechanical design.
The model focuses on design accuracy, logical component breakdown, and proper assembly hierarchy, rather than performance validation or CFD/thermal analysis.
